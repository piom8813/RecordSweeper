# Mugshot Sites

Unlike the opt-outs of the public record databases, removing your information from mugshot sites is not as easy. Many of these websites charge several hundred dollars to remove your mugshot and other criminal history information. Some sites will remove your record for free, but that is only if you record was [sealed or expunged](https://www.expeal.com/).
