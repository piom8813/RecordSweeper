# Individual Sites

We have found the following public record data publishers. Some of them use [data aggregators](aggregators.md) while others use have their own propretiary sources. You will have to remove your name from each of these databases to be sure your public records are no longer on these websites. It is important to note that removal from these databases doesn't remove your records from the original source (often either public records or newspaper/media mentions). However, most people don't even know how to get the original sources, so you make it much harder for this information to end up in the hands of people who shouldn't have it.
