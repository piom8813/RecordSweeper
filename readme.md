## How can I get involved?

If you find a public record data publisher that we've missed, open an issue using our [contribution template](contribution-template.md) and let us know about it! It would be helpful if you provide a link to the terms of service and privacy policy, if you can find them. If you find an opt-out link or have instructions about how to remove your information, even better!

## Contents

1. [Aggregators](aggregators.md) - These are the main sources for all the [individual sites](individual-sites.md). If you remove your name from these sites, you'll have removed your name from most - but not all - public record databases out there.

2. [Individual Sites](individual-sites.md) - We have found the following public record data publishers. Some of them use data aggregators while others use have their own propretiary sources. You will have to remove your name from each of these databases to be portive your public records are no longer online.

3. [Mugshot Sites](mugshot-sites.md) - Unlike the opt-outs of the public record databases, removing your information from mugshot sites is not as easy. Many of these websites charge several hundred dollars to remove your mugshot and other criminal history information. Some sites will remove your record for free, but that is only if you record was sealed or expunged.

4. [Before You Finish](before-you-finish.md) - There are a few steps you should take to make sure that when you clear your public record, it stays clear. These are the same things we do, for ourselves and our families. These are also things you should do whether you qualify to erase your criminal record or not.
