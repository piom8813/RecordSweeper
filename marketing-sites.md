# Marketing Sites

These are marketing sites that don't display your information like [individual sites](individual-sites.md), but collect and sell it to other sites and other people, like [data aggregators](aggregators.md). We recommend you opt-out of the DMA (on our data aggregators page) but *not* from these sites unless you know they actually have your information. Otherwise, you risk giving them a full profile to sell to someone else.
